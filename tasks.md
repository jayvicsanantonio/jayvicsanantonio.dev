# Safari Compatibility Tasks

This document outlines all tasks needed to ensure cross-browser compatibility and smooth 60fps animations between Safari and Chrome.

## Background

Safari has historically lagged behind Chrome in supporting modern CSS features. Our codebase uses several cutting-edge features that either don't work in Safari or cause significant performance degradation. This creates an inconsistent user experience where the site looks and performs differently across browsers. The main issues include:

- **Container Queries**: Not supported in Safari < 16.0, causing layout failures
- **View Transitions**: No support in Safari, breaking smooth page transitions
- **Backdrop-Filter Performance**: Causes severe animation stuttering in Safari
- **CSS Nesting**: Less efficient parsing in Safari's CSS engine
- **GPU Compositing**: Different optimization strategies needed for Safari's rendering engine

## 1. Container Queries Fallback Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Container queries (`@container` and `container-type`) are used extensively for responsive components but are not supported in Safari versions before 16.0. This causes layout breakage where components don't respond to their container size, leading to overlapping content, incorrect spacing, and broken grid layouts.

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: **COMPLETED** with critical discovery about Tailwind CSS v4 limitations.

**Current Impact** (RESOLVED):

- ✅ WorkTimeline cards now resize properly with viewport-based fallbacks
- ✅ SkillsAndCases grid layout adapts correctly using adaptive classes
- ✅ Mobile layouts work consistently across Safari versions

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: During implementation, we discovered that Tailwind CSS v4 does not support nesting `@utility` directives inside `@supports` blocks. This forced a redesign of the Safari compatibility strategy from CSS-based to JavaScript-based fallbacks, which ultimately proved more robust and flexible.

### 1.1 Add Container Query Feature Detection

**Context**: We need to detect browser support for container queries to provide appropriate fallbacks.

**Details**:

- [x] **Create `lib/utils/containerQueries.ts`** with detection function:
  ```typescript
  export const supportsContainerQueries = (): boolean => {
    if (typeof window === "undefined") return false;
    return CSS.supports("container-type: inline-size");
  };
  ```
- [x] **Add CSS feature detection in `app/globals.css`**:
  ```css
  @supports not (container-type: inline-size) {
    .cq-fallback {
      /* Fallback styles for non-supporting browsers */
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] **Create responsive utility classes** that mirror container query breakpoints:
  ```css
  .container-fallback-sm {
    /* equivalent to [@container(min-width:24rem)] */
  }
  .container-fallback-md {
    /* equivalent to [@container(min-width:32rem)] */
  }
  .container-fallback-lg {
    /* equivalent to [@container(min-width:42rem)] */
  }
  ```

**Why this approach**: Progressive enhancement ensures the site works everywhere while taking advantage of container queries where supported.

### 1.2 Refactor WorkTimeline Component

**Context**: Lines 239, 241, 255 in `WorkTimeline.client.tsx` use container queries for responsive padding and text sizing that fail in Safari.

**Current Problem**:

```tsx
// This breaks in Safari < 16.0
className = "[@container(min-width:36rem)]:p-6";
className = "[@container(min-width:28rem)]:text-2xl";
className = "[@container(min-width:34rem)]:space-y-4";
```

**Details**:

- [x] **Replace container query classes with conditional rendering**:
  ```tsx
  const useContainerQueries = supportsContainerQueries();
  const containerClasses = useContainerQueries
    ? "[@container(min-width:36rem)]:p-6"
    : "sm:p-6 md:p-8";
  ```
- [x] **Add responsive breakpoint fallbacks** using standard Tailwind classes
- [x] **Test layout at different viewport sizes** to ensure consistency
- [x] **Implement ResizeObserver fallback** for older Safari versions to manually trigger layout changes

**Why this approach**: Maintains the desired responsive behavior while ensuring compatibility across all Safari versions.

### 1.3 Refactor SkillsAndCases Component

**Context**: Lines 125, 132, 134 use container queries for grid layout and image sizing that completely breaks the card layout in Safari.

**Current Problem**: The grid layout fails to activate and images don't size properly:

```tsx
className =
  "[@container(min-width:36rem)]:grid [@container(min-width:36rem)]:grid-cols-[1fr,1.5fr]";
className = "[@container(min-width:28rem)]:h-44 [@container(min-width:36rem)]:h-full";
```

**Details**:

- [x] **Implement responsive grid with standard breakpoints**:
  ```tsx
  const gridClasses = supportsContainerQueries()
    ? "[@container(min-width:36rem)]:grid [@container(min-width:36rem)]:grid-cols-[1fr,1.5fr]"
    : "lg:grid lg:grid-cols-[1fr,1.5fr]";
  ```
- [x] **Create responsive image sizing fallbacks** using viewport-based breakpoints
- [x] **Add manual container width detection** using ResizeObserver for precise control
- [x] **Test card layouts in narrow containers** to ensure content doesn't overflow

**Why this approach**: Ensures the card layout works regardless of browser support while maintaining the intended responsive design.

### 1.4 Update Global Container Utility

**Context**: The `@utility cq` declaration in `globals.css:85` enables container queries but needs fallback handling.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Tailwind CSS v4 does not support `@utility` directives nested inside `@supports` blocks. Attempting to do so causes CSS parsing errors that break the entire layout.

**Details**:

- [x] **Simplified container utility implementation**:

  ```css
  /* Container Query Support - Simplified approach */
  @utility cq {
    container-type: inline-size;
  }
  ```

- [x] **Removed complex @supports wrapping** that caused parsing errors
- [x] **Implemented Safari fallbacks at the component level** using JavaScript utilities (`getAdaptiveClasses()`, `useContainerSize()`)
- [x] **Created comprehensive documentation** for when to use container queries vs viewport queries

**LESSONS LEARNED**:

- **CSS Parsing Limitation**: `@utility` cannot be nested in `@supports` blocks in Tailwind v4
- **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**: Fallbacks must be handled in JavaScript/component logic rather than pure CSS
- **Error Impact**: CSS parsing errors can break entire page layouts, not just the specific feature
- **Custom Utility Reliability**: Custom `@utility` declarations can have unexpected behavior (e.g., `page-container` centering issues, removed in favor of proven patterns)
- **Proven Patterns**: Standard Tailwind classes (`mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4`) are more reliable than custom utilities

**Why this approach**: While we cannot provide CSS-level fallbacks for the utility itself, the JavaScript-based approach provides more flexible and reliable Safari compatibility through component-level adaptive classes. Additionally, using proven Tailwind patterns instead of custom utilities ensures consistent behavior across all use cases.

## 2. View Transitions Progressive Enhancement

**Problem**: View Transitions API is used for smooth page morphing between routes but is completely unsupported in Safari. This causes the navigation to fall back to instant page changes, creating a jarring user experience compared to Chrome's smooth transitions.

**Current Impact**:

- No smooth morphing between pages in Safari
- `vt-tag-*` classes have no effect
- Inconsistent user experience between browsers

### 2.1 Create View Transition Detection Utility

**Context**: We need to detect browser support and gracefully handle unsupported browsers.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create `lib/utils/viewTransitions.ts`**:

  ```typescript
  export const supportsViewTransitions = (): boolean => {
    return typeof document !== "undefined" && "startViewTransition" in document;
  };

  export const safeViewTransition = (callback: () => void) => {
    if (supportsViewTransitions()) {
      document.startViewTransition(callback);
    } else {
      callback();
    }
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Add hook for view transition support**: `hooks/useViewTransitions.ts`
- [ ] **Create fallback animation utilities** for non-supporting browsers

**Why this approach**: Enables progressive enhancement where supported browsers get smooth transitions while others get instant navigation.

### 2.2 Update View Transition CSS

**Context**: Lines 374-402 in `globals.css` define view transition animations that do nothing in Safari.

**Current Problem**: CSS rules for `::view-transition-image-pair()` are ignored, bloating the stylesheet.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Wrap view transition CSS in feature queries**:

  ```css
  @supports (view-transition-name: test) {
    .vt-tag-projects {
      view-transition-name: projects;
    }

    ::view-transition-image-pair(projects) {
      animation-duration: 300ms;
      animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Add fallback transition styles** for non-supporting browsers
- [ ] **Implement CSS-based page transition fallbacks** using opacity and transform

**Why this approach**: Reduces CSS bloat in Safari while maintaining smooth transitions where supported.

### 2.3 Refactor Navigation Components

**Context**: Components using `vt-tag-*` classes need fallback behavior for Safari.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Update navigation components** to conditionally apply view transition tags
- [ ] **Implement CSS transition fallbacks** for Safari:
  ```tsx
  const transitionClasses = supportsViewTransitions()
    ? "vt-tag-projects"
    : "transition-opacity duration-300";
  ```
- [ ] **Add loading states** for navigation in Safari
- [ ] **Test navigation smoothness** across different page types

**Why this approach**: Provides consistent navigation experience regardless of browser capabilities.

### 2.4 Test Cross-Browser Navigation

**Context**: Ensure navigation feels smooth and consistent across all browsers.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create automated tests** for navigation timing
- [ ] **Test on various Safari versions** (desktop and mobile)
- [ ] **Measure perceived performance** of navigation transitions
- [ ] **Validate fallback animations** feel natural and not abrupt

**Why this approach**: Ensures quality user experience across all browser environments.

## 3. Backdrop-Filter Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Safari's implementation of `backdrop-filter` is significantly less optimized than Chrome's. When combined with animations, it causes severe performance degradation, often dropping below 30fps during transitions. This is especially problematic with the extensive glass morphism effects used throughout the site.

**Current Impact**:

- Choppy animations on all glass components
- Poor performance on mobile Safari
- Inconsistent visual quality between browsers

### 3.1 Audit All Backdrop-Filter Usage

**Context**: We need to identify every use of backdrop-filter to prioritize optimization efforts.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create comprehensive inventory** of all backdrop-filter usage:
  - `GlassButton.tsx:21` - Navigation buttons
  - `GlassHeaderBubble.tsx` - Multiple glass elements
  - `MorphingVideo.client.tsx` - Hero section backdrop effects
  - Mobile navigation components - Glass overlay effects
- [ ] **Categorize by performance impact**: High (animated), Medium (static), Low (occasional)
- [ ] **Measure current performance** using Chrome DevTools on Safari
- [ ] **Document visual requirements** for each backdrop-filter use case

**Why this approach**: Systematic audit ensures we optimize the most impactful elements first.

### 3.2 Optimize Glass Morphism Components

**Context**: Glass morphism components combine backdrop-filter with other effects, compounding performance issues in Safari.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Add hardware acceleration hints** to all glass components:
  ```css
  .glass-optimized {
    transform: translateZ(0);
    -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
    will-change: transform;
    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Separate backdrop-filter from animations**:
  ```css
  .glass-element {
    backdrop-filter: blur(16px);
    transition: transform 0.3s ease-out; /* Don't animate backdrop-filter */
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Implement Safari-specific reduced effects**:
  ```tsx
  const isSafari = /Safari/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !/Chrome/.test(navigator.userAgent);
  const backdropClass = isSafari ? "bg-white/80" : "backdrop-blur-[16px] bg-white/20";
  ```

**Why this approach**: Maintains visual fidelity while ensuring smooth animations on Safari.

### 3.3 Refactor MorphingVideo Component

**Context**: Lines 79-80 animate backdrop-filter simultaneously with multiple other properties, causing severe performance issues.

**Current Problem**:

```typescript
transition: isExpanding
  ? "backdrop-filter 0.5s ease-out, transform 2s cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1), ..."
  : "...";
```

**Details**:

- [ ] **Split complex transition into stages**:

  ```typescript
  // Stage 1: Transform and layout
  transition: "transform 2s cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1), border-radius 2s...";

  // Stage 2: Visual effects (delayed)
  const backdropTransition = {
    transitionDelay: "1.8s",
    transitionProperty: "backdrop-filter",
    transitionDuration: "0.2s",
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Add conditional backdrop-filter application** based on animation state
- [ ] **Implement Safari-specific animation sequence** with reduced complexity
- [ ] **Use CSS custom properties** for dynamic backdrop-filter values

**Why this approach**: Eliminates simultaneous animation of multiple expensive properties while maintaining visual impact.

### 3.4 Create Safari-Optimized Glass Effects

**Context**: Safari needs different strategies for glass effects to maintain performance.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create Safari-specific glass utilities**:

  ```css
  .glass-safari {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
    box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    /* Solid background instead of backdrop-filter during animations */
  }

  .glass-safari.animated {
    backdrop-filter: none;
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement conditional backdrop-filter application**:
  ```tsx
  const useBackdropFilter = !isSafari || !isAnimating;
  ```
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring** to track FPS during glass animations
- [ ] **Test on multiple iOS devices** to ensure consistent performance

**Why this approach**: Provides the best possible glass effect performance on Safari while maintaining visual consistency.

## 4. Framer Motion Safari Optimization

**Problem**: Framer Motion animations combined with backdrop-filter and 3D transforms cause Safari's compositor to struggle. The library's default optimization strategies are tuned for Chrome, leading to poor performance in Safari.

**Current Impact**:

- Timeline animations stutter and drop frames
- 3D transform animations are janky
- Poor interaction responsiveness

### 4.1 Refactor WorkTimeline Animations

**Context**: Line 228 combines Framer Motion with backdrop-filter and 3D transforms, causing performance issues.

**Current Problem**:

```tsx
className =
  "transform-gpu backdrop-blur-[24px] hover:[transform:perspective(1000px)_rotateX(0.6deg)_rotateY(-0.6deg)]";
```

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create Safari-specific animation variants**:

  ```tsx
  const safariVariants = {
    initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
    animate: {
      opacity: 1,
      y: 0,
      transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" },
    },
    hover: {
      y: -4, // Simpler transform for Safari
      transition: { duration: 0.2 },
    },
  };

  const chromeVariants = {
    // More complex 3D transforms
    hover: {
      rotateX: 0.6,
      rotateY: -0.6,
      y: -4,
      transition: { duration: 0.2 },
    },
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Separate backdrop-filter from motion components**:
  ```tsx
  <motion.div variants={motionVariants}>
    <div className={backdropClasses}>{/* Content */}</div>
  </motion.div>
  ```
- [ ] **Implement staggered animations** for timeline entries
- [ ] **Add will-change management** for motion components

**Why this approach**: Optimizes for each browser's strengths while maintaining smooth animations.

### 4.2 Optimize Motion Components

**Context**: All Framer Motion components need Safari-specific optimizations.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Create motion optimization hook**:
  ```tsx
  const useMotionConfig = () => {
    const isSafari = useMemo(() => /* safari detection */, []);
    return {
      transition: isSafari
        ? { type: "tween", ease: "easeOut" }
        : { type: "spring", damping: 20 },
      reducedMotion: isSafari && prefersReducedMotion
    };
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Implement animation sequencing** for complex motions
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring** to motion components
- [ ] **Create Safari-specific transition presets**

**Why this approach**: Provides consistent motion design while optimizing for browser capabilities.

### 4.3 Create Animation Utility Functions

**Context**: Centralize animation logic for consistent Safari optimization.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Build browser detection utility**:
  ```tsx
  export const getBrowserCapabilities = () => ({
    supportsBackdropFilter: CSS.supports("backdrop-filter: blur(1px)"),
    supports3DTransforms: CSS.supports("transform: perspective(1px)"),
    supportsWillChange: CSS.supports("will-change: transform"),
    isSafari: /Safari/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !/Chrome/.test(navigator.userAgent),
  });
  ```
- [ ] **Create optimized animation variants** for different scenarios
- [ ] **Implement conditional animation logic** based on browser capabilities
- [ ] **Add animation performance utilities** for monitoring and debugging

**Why this approach**: Ensures consistent optimization strategies across all components.

### 5.1 Flatten Complex CSS Nesting

**Context**: Lines 211-256 in `globals.css` use deep nesting that Safari's parser handles less efficiently.

**Current Problem**:

```css
.lights {
  & svg {
    & svg:nth-child(2) ~ svg {
      @media (min-width: 400px) {
        display: block;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Details**:

- [ ] **Flatten nested selectors** to reduce parser complexity:
  ```css
  .lights svg {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
  }
  .lights svg:nth-child(n + 2) {
    display: none;
  }
  @media (min-width: 400px) {
    .lights svg:nth-child(n + 2) {
      display: block;
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Simplify complex selector chains** for better Safari performance
- [ ] **Use class-based targeting** instead of complex pseudo-selectors where possible
- [ ] **Measure CSS parse time** improvements

**Why this approach**: Reduces CSS parsing overhead in Safari while maintaining the same visual result.

### 5.2 GPU Compositing Layer Management

**Context**: Safari requires different strategies for GPU compositing optimization.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Add strategic `will-change` properties**:
  ```css
  .scroll-element {
    will-change: transform, opacity;
    transform: translateZ(0); /* Force layer creation */
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Implement `transform: translateZ(0)` for compositing layers**
- [ ] **Add `backface-visibility: hidden`** to prevent unnecessary repaints
- [ ] **Audit and optimize layer creation** to avoid excessive memory usage
- [ ] **Create compositing layer utility classes** for consistent application

**Why this approach**: Optimizes GPU usage for Safari's rendering engine while maintaining smooth animations.

### 5.3 Optimize Scroll-Based Animations

**Context**: The `useScrollCssVariables` hook drives many animations but may not be optimized for Safari.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Add passive event listeners** for better scroll performance:
  ```typescript
  window.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { passive: true });
  ```
- [ ] **Implement RAF throttling** for scroll updates:
  ```typescript
  const onScroll = () => {
    if (raf) cancelAnimationFrame(raf);
    raf = requestAnimationFrame(updateScrollVariables);
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Optimize CSS custom property updates** to batch DOM writes
- [ ] **Add Safari-specific scroll optimizations** using `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`

**Why this approach**: Ensures smooth scroll-driven animations on Safari while maintaining responsiveness.

### 5.4 Content Visibility Fallbacks

**Context**: `content-visibility: auto` is used for performance but has limited Safari support.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Add feature detection**:

  ```css
  @supports (content-visibility: auto) {
    .content-visibility-auto {
      content-visibility: auto;
    }
  }

  @supports not (content-visibility: auto) {
    .content-visibility-auto {
      /* Fallback intersection observer implementation */
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement IntersectionObserver fallback** for non-supporting browsers
- [ ] **Test rendering performance** with and without content-visibility
- [ ] **Add progressive enhancement** for content loading

**Why this approach**: Provides performance benefits where supported while ensuring compatibility.

## 6. Text and Typography Enhancements

**Problem**: CSS `text-balance` is used for improved typography but isn't supported in Safari, causing different text wrapping behavior between browsers.

### 6.1 Text-Balance Fallbacks

**Context**: Lines 105, 113, 128 in `MorphingVideo.client.tsx` use `text-balance` which Safari doesn't support.

**Current Problem**: Text wrapping differs between Safari and Chrome, affecting visual consistency.

**Details**:

- [ ] **Detect text-balance support**:
  ```typescript
  const supportsTextBalance = CSS.supports("text-wrap: balance");
  ```
- [ ] **Implement manual text balancing** for Safari:
  ```tsx
  const useTextBalance = (text: string, maxWidth: number) => {
    // Manual line break insertion logic for balanced text
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Add responsive typography** that works consistently across browsers
- [ ] **Test text rendering** at various viewport sizes

**Why this approach**: Ensures consistent typography appearance across all browsers.

### 6.2 Font Rendering Optimization
